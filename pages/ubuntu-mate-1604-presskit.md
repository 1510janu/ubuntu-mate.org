With Ubuntu MATE 16.04 due for release on April 21st 2016 this page
will help you better understand what Ubuntu MATE is and how its been
improved since the 15.10 release.

## Introduction

Ubuntu MATE is an community developed [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com)
based operating system that beautifully integrates the [MATE
Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org) and offers a stable, easy-to-use
operating system with a configurable desktop environment. Ideal for
those who want the most out of their computers and prefer a traditional
desktop metaphor. With modest hardware requirements it is suitable for
modern desktops and laptops, single board computers and older hardware alike.
Ubuntu MATE makes modern computers fast and old comuters usable.

### Objectives

Ubuntu MATE has a number of guiding objectives and goals.

  * Accessible to all, regardless of language and physical ability.
  * Increase both [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) and [MATE Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org) user adoption.
  * Ubuntu alternative for computers that aren't powerful enough to run a composited desktop.
  * First choice Ubuntu platform for remote workstation solutions such as [X2Go](http://x2go.org).
  * Recreate the halcyon days of Ubuntu for users who prefer a traditional desktop metaphor.
  * Use themes and artwork similar to Ubuntu so that Ubuntu MATE is immediately familiar.
  * When possible contribute to [Debian](http://www.debian.org) so both the Debian and Ubuntu communities benefit.
  * Software selection will favour functionality and stability over lightness and whimsy.

## New in Ubuntu MATE 16.04

    * Fixes and improvements for GTK3 support across the entire MATE Desktop including GTK 3.18 support.
    * **Touchpad support is significantly improved and now features multi touch and natural scrolling**.

    * **Improved session management** which now includes screensaver inhibition while playing media.
    * Extended `systemd` support.
    * Long standing bugs and many little **usability paper-cuts were fixed**.
    * **Consistent categorisation** of the Control Center and System menus.
    * See the [MATE Desktop 1.12 release announcement](http://mate-desktop.org/blog/2015-11-05-mate-1-12-released/) for more details.

    * The default Ubuntu MATE themes have been **refined to minimise differences between GTK3 and GTK2**.
    * Updated **Compiz `gtk-window-manager` to get settings directly from MATE**, not GNOME, when running in a MATE session.

  * **MATE Tweak capabilities have been extended**.
    * Option to enable **Keyboard LED to show a CapsLock and NumLock status indicator** for modern laptops and wireless keyboards that no longer have built in status LEDs.
    * **Added Compton GPU accelerated compositing**, as an alternative to Compiz, for those seeking **tear free video playback**.

  * Added **MATE Dock Applet** developed by [Robin Thompson](https://github.com/robint99).
    * A **configurable dock applet that can be placed on any panel, in any orientation**.
  * Added **Topmenu Applet** developed by [Javier S. Pedro](https://javispedro.com/me.html)
    * A **GTK+ module that allows placing a global menu in MATE panel applets**.
    * The **Ubuntu MATE team also added `lxpanel-plugin-topmenu` and `xfce4-topmenu-plugin` to the Debian and Ubuntu archives** so those desktops can benefit too.
  * Added **Mutiny panel layout which showcases `mate-dock-applet` and `topmenu-gtk`**.
    * *The traditional GNOME2 style two panel layout is, and will continue to be, the default*.
    * The Mutiny layout is a Unity-like interface design to showcase MATE Dock Applet and Topmenu Applet.

    * Synapse is a **graphical launcher enabling you to start applications and also to quickly find and access relevant documents and files** (by making use of the Zeitgeist engine).
    * The Synapse Launcher be enabled via MATE Tweak.
  * Updated to **Plank 0.11 and includes a new theme for Ubuntu MATE** contributed by [Holger Rueckershaeuser](http://holgerrpl.tk/).
  * **DVD and BluRay libraries are pre-installed**
    * *This doesn't mean encrypted DVD and BluRay will play out-of-the-box, but they can be fully enabled via Ubuntu MATE Welcome.*.
  * **Vastly expanded language support**, the full rationale on how we choose the languages and what we install is available from <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1520278>.

combined!** You grab the download and find out more from the
[Ubuntu MATE Raspberry Pi page](/raspberry-pi/).

We've also created an
[Ubuntu MATE generic root file system and example build scripts](/armhf-rootfs/)
for OEMs and ARM hackers who'd like bring Ubuntu MATE to their ARMv7 devices.
