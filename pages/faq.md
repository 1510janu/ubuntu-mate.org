If we get asked something frequently enough we'll try to provide the
answers here.

## What is Ubuntu MATE exactly?

See our [What is Ubuntu MATE?](/what-is-ubuntu-mate/) page.

## Is Ubuntu MATE an official Canonical project?

No, it is an Ubuntu community project.

## OK, so *who is* behind Ubuntu MATE?

Take a look at [our team](/team/) page to see the all-star cast who
have made Ubuntu MATE possible.

## Is Ubuntu MATE an official Ubuntu *"flavour"*?

  * Ubuntu MATE 15.04 and onward are **official** Ubuntu flavours.
  * Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and Ubuntu MATE 14.10 are *unofficial* builds.

## Will you be making a 14.04 LTS version of Ubuntu MATE?

We have, although it is not an official build. You can get it here:

  * [Ubuntu MATE 14.04.2 LTS](https://ubuntu-mate.org/trusty/)

We have also posted [a HOW-TO for installing your own Ubuntu MATE 14.04 from scratch](/blog/2014-08-ubuntu-mate-14-04-from-scratch/).

## Why is *xyz* application installed by default when I prefer *abc* application?

In general, the default application selection follows what shipped in
Ubuntu 14.04. The only reason we deviate from the default Ubuntu
applications is if they are not compatible with Ubuntu MATE or pull in
lots of unnecessary dependencies.

The reason for using the default applications as shipped by Ubuntu is
the Ubuntu staff support the default applications. The Ubuntu MATE team
is rather small so sharing the support responsibility makes sense, both
for us and our users.

## Why is *xyz* application installed default when *abc* application is better?

See the answer to the question above.

## Will Ubuntu MATE run on my computer?

If you have a computer from Entroware, System 76, ZaReason or Think
Penguin then Ubuntu MATE will absolutely run on your computer. Computers
from major vendors such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo will most
likely run Ubuntu MATE just fine too.

Ubuntu MATE is designed to run on almost any computer hardware. Of
course Ubuntu MATE runs particularly well on the newest, fastest
hardware, but it also runs well on almost any vintage of machine. In
fact, an older computer designed during the Windows XP era, can easily
be outfitted with the new, modern and fully-supported Ubuntu MATE and
it will likely run better than it did with the previously installed
operating system.

## Can I use iTunes on Ubuntu MATE?

No. This is one of those programs that is specifically designed by Apple
*NOT* to run on Linux. Although Mac OS X has its roots in the same UNIX
philosphy as Linux, OS X is not the same as Linux, and applications
written for Apple's operating system do not automatically run on Linux.
There are, however plenty of alternative media players that will play
music, create play lists, sync with mobile devices, and retrieve, manage
and play podcasts. Rythmbox is provided with Ubuntu MATE and can play any
of the music or podcasts in your iTunes library.

## Is Ubuntu MATE secure and safe to use?

Ubuntu MATE is designed with security in mind. Unlike operating systems
that update only once a month, Ubuntu MATE receives updates continuously.
The updates include security patches for Ubuntu MATE and all of its
components. Security updates for all of its installed applications are
also provided on the same schedule. This ensures that you have the latest
protection for *all* of your computer's software, as soon as it's available!

## Is Ubuntu MATE more secure than other operating systems?

We think that security on Linux systems like Ubuntu MATE is superior.
Ubuntu MATE users are not administrators by default. Administrators
("root" users) on any computer system have permission to do anything
they want, including the ability to damage the system.

For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to
determine which program should open it, then immediately attempt to
open it! That design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a
computer. Ubuntu MATE opens a file based on what the file is, not based
on its name. So even if a malicious program disguises its identity by
using the name "Last Will and Testament.txt" Ubuntu MATE will recognize
the file as a program. The system provides a warning that the file is
not a text file, but that it is a program that will be run if you give
it permission to continue. To be extra secure, Ubuntu MATE requires you
to provide your administrator password before that permission is
granted. Every single time.

## Can Ubuntu MATE get computer viruses and malware?

Ubuntu MATE can get viruses and other infections... but it doesn't.
Rapid and timely updates ensure that there are very few, if any threats
to Linux systems like Ubuntu MATE that persist in the wild. In reality,
there have been very few "public" infections in the last 10 years that
can affect Ubuntu MATE. They are no longer a threat to anyone
installing or using a modern Linux distribution today. Ubuntu MATE is
designed to make it difficult for viruses, root kits and other malware
to be installed and run without conscious intervention by you, the
user. Even if you do accidentally invite in an infection, chances are
it's designed to attack Windows and won't do much, if any damage to
Ubuntu MATE.

## How can Ubuntu MATE be free?

What Linux, Ubuntu and MATE Desktop all have in common is they are Open
Source. Open Source software is software that can be freely used,
changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. In a
nutshell Ubuntu MATE is free, in the truest sense of the word.

Although you will find some versions (distributions) of Linux for
purchase, the vast majority are provided free of charge, like Ubuntu
MATE. Open Source software is licensed in a way that allows anyone to
give it away for free, no strings attached. For example, the licence
gives any member of the user community the freedom to use Linux for any
purpose, to distribute, modify, redistribute, or even sell the
operating system. If you do modify and then redistribute Linux with
your modifications, you are required by the licence to submit your
modifications for possible inclusion into future versions. There is no
guarantee that this will ever happen, but if you have made it better,
then your changes just might be included in the next release of Ubuntu
MATE.

Many of the users of Linux are corporations that use the operating system
to run their businesses, or include it within their products. Many of
these corporations provide fixes and new features for Linux as they use
the software for their businesses. These improvements are given back to
the Linux community and Ubuntu MATE improves as a result.

This is how we can continually improve and grow without having to charge
our users money.

## I've got a question. Where do I ask?

Ask the [Ubuntu MATE community](/community/).

## What has Ubuntu MATE got planned for the future?

Hopefully our [roadmap](/roadmap/) outlines some of what we have
planned. If you have any ideas yourself, we'd love to hear from you.
