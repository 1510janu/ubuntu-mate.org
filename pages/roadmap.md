During the Ubuntu MATE 14.10 development cycle the main objective was
to produce an Ubuntu distribution with a pure MATE desktop experience,
that (mostly) worked and anyone could use. I think we just about
delivered on that and even excelled in some areas, particularly what
the artwork team produced.

But this was our first attempt at putting a desktop operating system
together. Other Ubuntu flavours have had many years head start and
therefore been able to refine what they offer, we need to play catch up.

This page outlines some of the activities the Ubuntu MATE team will
research, and possibly implement, in future development cycles to
improve and refine our operating system.

## User experience

I am reliably informed that everything is a *user experience* these
days. User interfaces are, apparently, pass√©.

The MATE desktop offers a traditional desktop metaphor but it is also
extremely customisable. When combined with some 3rd party applications
Ubuntu MATE can be augmented to provide an "*experience*" similar to
what other contemporary desktop environments offer while retaining its
classic desktop paradigm.

### Launchers and Docks

We will evaluate 3rd party launchers, such as Slingscold,
[Synapse](http://synapse.zeitgeist-project.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page),
[The Duck Launcher](https://the-duck.github.io/) and 3rd party docks,
such as [Plank](http://wiki.go-docky.com/?title=Plank:Introduction), to
see how they can be integrated with Ubuntu MATE to make user interaction
with the desktop more efficient.

Launchers and docks are not to everyone's tastes so we will conduct
community polls (just as we have done in the past) to determine if the
selected 3rd party tools should be integrated as defaults or optional
extras.

### Compiz

There are some hardcore Compiz addicts in the MATE community. That said
Compiz will never be enabled by default in Ubuntu MATE, but we do want
to cater for those people who want it. Compiz does include some
features that are of real benefit, such as the Enhanced Zoom plug-in
which is useful for individuals with low vision.

The Ubuntu MATE team will create a simple way for Compiz to be
installed and enabled for those users who want it.

 * *Implemented since Ubuntu MATE 15.04*

### Ubuntu MATE Tweak

There are a plethora of options behind MATE that are not yet exposed
via control centre applets. The Ubuntu MATE team have already provided
a simple tool to tweak your MATE configuration called MATE Tweak and
over time that tool be be enhanced and improved.

A number of different panel layouts are already available in Ubuntu MATE.
Panel layouts that offer a pure MATE desktop will continue to be made
available and others added that may also rely on 3rd party launchers,
docks or even Compiz. We will provide a tool to switch between these
different desktop layouts that also enables/disables the appropriate
launchers and docks where required.

  * *Implemented since Ubuntu MATE 15.04 via **MATE Tweak***

### Artwork

The artwork team have only just got warmed up. We can't wait to see
where they are going to take Ubuntu MATE in the future.

## Accessibility

Making an accessible operating system was a key priority when the
Ubuntu MATE founders initially set out the goals of the project.

### Assistive technologies

Ubuntu MATE is never going to be able to offer the comprehensive
integration of assistive technologies that [Sonar GNU/Linux](http://sonargnulinux.com/)
provides. But we will continue to follow their lead so that Ubuntu MATE
is a viable desktop solution where computer access is shared within a
household or business where individual needs differ.

### Complex input methods

We've received feedback that complex input method support in Ubuntu
MATE could be better.

MATE does have support for complex input methods right now, but having
spoken to some users in China and Japan, we now better understand their
requirements. To that end we've documented how to install and enable
IBus and fcitx on the [download page](/download/). That was just the
first step in ensuring everyone is catered for and in the future we
will integrate either [IBus](https://code.google.com/p/ibus/) or
[fcitx](https://fcitx-im.org/) into Ubuntu MATE to address this short
coming.

 * *Implemented since Ubuntu MATE 15.10*

### Translation

Translation of Ubuntu and MATE desktop is handled upstream thanks to
the tireless efforts of many translators, therefore the Ubuntu MATE
operating system is available in many languages. However, this website
is currently available in English only and we will work with the
community to make it available other languages too.

## Doing more, finding more.

Installing Ubuntu MATE is just the beginning. By making applications
and content easily discoverable we hope that it will promote greater
community engagement and broaden our awareness of the free culture
movement and the quality of the content the free culture community
produces.

### Application web install

Users new to Linux are often overwhelmed by the vast choice of software
on offer. The Ubuntu MATE team will create a curated selection of
applications suitable for use with Ubuntu MATE that can be installed
via one click from our website.

The Ubuntu MATE community will select one application (at most two)
that is more suitable for a given task or activity so that new users
can quickly turn their Ubuntu MATE workstation into a productive tool.

  * *Implemented since Ubuntu MATE 15.10 via **Ubuntu MATE Welcome***

### Content discovery

The free culture movement is a hot bed of creativity and produces some
amazing content that is free of DRM and other usage restrictions. The
Ubuntu MATE website will add a content discovery mini site that will
help the Ubuntu MATE community to discover the best in free music,
books, TV, comics, art, podcasts that the world has to offer.

### Media casting and streaming

Seamless integration with home media server content and media casting
devices is essential in order for Ubuntu MATE to remain relevant
for many home users. We will try to deliver on that.

Similarly being able to access popular subscription-based streaming
services such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video and Spotify is also an
expectation for many users. While the Ubuntu MATE team can do little
to deliver the technologies to make this happen, we can provide simple
installation options to enable access to these services, and where
possible, ship the required software by default.

  * *Implemented since Ubuntu MATE 15.10 by using Ubuntu MATE Welcome to install Google Chrome, Spotify or Pithos*

### Mobile device integration

Currently Ubuntu MATE has the essential mobile device support you'd
expect. You can plug in a phone or a media player and the device is
automatically detected and mounted, you can then access the files on it.

  * *Implemented since Ubuntu MATE 15.10*

But we'd like to go futher by providing a way for mobile device
notifications to be wirelessly mirrored to your Ubuntu MATE desktop and
for you to be able to send files or links wirelessly between your mobile
devices and Ubuntu MATE.
