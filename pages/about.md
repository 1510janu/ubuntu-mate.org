Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with a
configurable desktop environment. It is ideal for those who want the
most out of their computers and prefer a traditional desktop metaphor.
With modest hardware requirements it is suitable for modern
workstations, single board computers and older hardware alike.

        <p>We have created a page that tries to break down what exactly Ubuntu MATE is in easy to understand language. Have a read.</p>

## Objectives

Ubuntu MATE has a number of guiding objectives and goals.

  * Accessible to all, regardless of language and physical ability.
  * Increase both Ubuntu and MATE Desktop user adoption.
  * Ubuntu alternative for computers that aren't powerful enough to run a composited desktop.
  * First choice Ubuntu platform for remote workstation solutions such as [LTSP](http://www.ltsp.org/) and [X2Go](http://x2go.org).
  * Recreate the halcyon days of Ubuntu for users who prefer a traditional desktop metaphor.
  * Use themes and artwork similar to Ubuntu so that Ubuntu MATE is immediately familiar.
  * When possible contribute to [Debian](http://www.debian.org) so both the Debian and Ubuntu communities benefit.
  * Software selection will favour functionality and stability over lightness and whimsy.
