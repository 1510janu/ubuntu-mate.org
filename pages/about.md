Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with a configurable desktop
environment. Ideal for those who want the most out of their desktops, laptops and
netbooks and prefer a traditional desktop metaphor. With modest hardware
requirements it is suitable for modern workstations and older hardware alike.

## Objectives

Ubuntu MATE has a number of guiding objectives and goals.

  * Accessible to all, regardless of language and physical ability.
  * Increase both Ubuntu and MATE Desktop user adoption.
  * Ubuntu alternative for computers that aren't powerful enough to run a composited desktop.
  * First choice Ubuntu platform for remote workstation solutions such as [LTSP](http://www.ltsp.org/) and [X2Go](http://x2go.org).
  * Recreate the halcyon days of Ubuntu for users who prefer a traditional desktop metaphor.
  * Use themes and artwork similar to Ubuntu so that Ubuntu MATE is immediately familiar.
  * When possible contribute to [Debian](http://www.debian.org) so both the Debian and Ubuntu communities benefit.
  * Package selection will favour functionality and stability over lightness and whimsy.
  * Get adopted as an official Ubuntu *"flavour"*.
