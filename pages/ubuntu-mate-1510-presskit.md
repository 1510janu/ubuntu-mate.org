With Ubuntu MATE 15.10 due for release on October 22nd 2015 this page
will help you better understand what Ubuntu MATE is and how its been
improved since the 15.04 release.

Ubuntu MATE is an community developed [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com)
based operating system that beautifully integrates the [MATE
Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org) and offers a stable, easy-to-use
operating system with a configurable desktop environment. Ideal for
those who want the most out of their computers and prefer a traditional
desktop metaphor. With modest hardware requirements it is suitable for
modern desktops and laptops, micro computers and older hardware alike.
Ubuntu MATE is an official member of the Ubuntu family.

## Objectives

Ubuntu MATE has a number of guiding objectives and goals.

  * Accessible to all, regardless of language and physical ability.
  * Increase both [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) and [MATE Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org) user adoption.
  * Ubuntu alternative for computers that aren't powerful enough to run a composited desktop.
  * First choice Ubuntu platform for remote workstation solutions such as [X2Go](http://x2go.org).
  * Recreate the halcyon days of Ubuntu for users who prefer a traditional desktop metaphor.
  * Use themes and artwork similar to Ubuntu so that Ubuntu MATE is immediately familiar.
  * When possible contribute to [Debian](http://www.debian.org) so both the Debian and Ubuntu communities benefit.
  * Software selection will favour functionality and stability over lightness and whimsy.

We are also delighted to provide a ready to run image for the
[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) 2 which has been [improved
based on the Raspberry Pi
community](/blog/ubuntu-mate-wily-for-raspberry-pi-2-is-coming/). We've
also created an [Ubuntu MATE generic root file system and example build
scripts](/armhf-rootfs/) for ARM hackers who'd like bring Ubuntu MATE
to their ARMv7 devices.

You grab the download and find out more from the [Ubuntu MATE Raspberry Pi page](/raspberry-pi/).
