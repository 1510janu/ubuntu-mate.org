[Linux Luddites](http://linuxluddites.com) reviewed Ubuntu MATE 14.04 in
[Episode #29](http://linuxluddites.com/shows/episode-29/). Ahead of their
review is a short interview with myself where we cover some of the new
features introduced in Ubuntu MATE 14.04, how it compares to Ubuntu MATE
14.10 and who helped create Ubuntu MATE.

I suggest you head over to the Linux Luddites website and give it a listen
and then read the comments after their show notes to see my feedback about
the Ubuntu MATE 14.04 review `:-)`

If you've not listened to the Linux Luddites before then you don't have your
podcatcher configured correctly. It has been one of my favourite FLOSS podcasts
for some months now that blends good discussion and insight with informative
distro reviews.
