Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to reward some
developers for working on Ubuntu MATE projects.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for February 2016.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for February 2016.
  * Donated **&euro;1535** (taking into account currency variations) to 8 Open Source developers working on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~500 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and
another ~1400 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2
and Raspberry Pi 3.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a
contribution to an Open Source project or developer that Ubuntu MATE
directly benefits from.

For February 2016 Ubuntu MATE have donated to several Open Source
developers who've worked on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer for (*Ubuntu MATE*) - **&pound;150** for working on Ubuntu MATE Welcome.
  * Developer for (*Fedora*) - **&euro;100** for porting MATE Desktop to GTK3.
  * Developer for (*Linux Mint*) - **&euro;100** for porting MATE Desktop to GTK3.
  * Developer for (*Debian*) **&euro;50** for packaging MATE Desktop in Debian.
  * Developer for (*Debian*) - **â‚¬650** for packaging and taking on maintainership of `topmenu-gtk`, `mate-dock-applet` and `libwnck` in Debian.
  * Developer for (*openSUSE*) - **&euro;100** for improving MATE integration with Compiz 0.9.x.
  * Developer for (*Ubuntu GNOME*) - **&euro;150** for completing MATE integration in Synapse and getting the new packages into Debain and Ubuntu.
  * Developer for (*Ubuntu MATE*) - **&pound;150** for adding a translation framework to Ubuntu MATE Welcome.

Thank you to everyone who has donated, you are really making a
difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE Desktop.
