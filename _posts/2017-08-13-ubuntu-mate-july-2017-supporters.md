Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project. **As
usual we've been able to fund some developers to work on Ubuntu MATE
and MATE Desktop projects.**

## How will this months crowd funding be spent?

This months crowd funding will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE Content Delivery Network, Web Application Firewall and email charges.
  * Paid **$1405.91** (taking into account currency variations) to Open Source developers for working on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
  * This brings Ubuntu MATEs total funding to Open Source projects and developers to approximately **$23808.26** (taking into account currency variations).

**Thank you!**

## Project Sponsorship

A huge thank you to everyone at
**[Bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/r/ubuntu-mate/) for
sponsoring Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop**. Bytemark are providing hosting
and covering all server/bandwidth costs for both projects. This
[sponsorship means nearly all of the Ubuntu MATE crowd
funding can be directed towards funding development
projects](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/bytemark-sponsor-ubuntu-mate/).

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month Ubuntu MATE has surplus funds we will make
contributions to Open Source projects, or developers working on
projects, that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

This month Ubuntu MATE has paid several Open Source developers to work
on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Debian Developer - **&euro;150** - For syncing all recent MATE packaging changes to Debian unstable.
  * Debian Maintainer - **&euro;150** - For syncing all recent MATE packaging changes to Debian unstable.
  * MATE Developer - **$400** - For fixing Super support in [MATE Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org), [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org) and [MATE Dock Applet](https://github.com/robint99/mate-dock-applet).
  * MATE Developer - **&euro;200** - For developing and bug fixing MATE Desktop.
  * MATE Developer - **&euro;100** - For developing and bug fixing MATE Desktop.
  * MATE Developer - **$200** - For developing and bug fixing MATE Desktop.
  * Ubuntu Developer - **$100** - For assisting with landing Vala Panel Appmenu in the Ubuntu archive in time for the 17.10 Alpha 1 release.
