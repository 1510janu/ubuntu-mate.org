[Sam Hewitt](http://snwh.org/) is an all-round good guy and design genius. I asked
Sam if he had the time to create a logo for the project and he created a complete set
of artwork for the Ubuntu MATE Remix project. What a nice bloke. You might be aware
that the Ubuntu logo as known as the *"circle of friends"*. Sam has dubbed the Ubuntu MATE
logo *"circle of MATEs"*. Brilliant!
