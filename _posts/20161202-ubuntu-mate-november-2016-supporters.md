Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project. **As usual
we've be able to fund some developers to work on Ubuntu MATE and MATE
Desktop projects.**

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month Ubuntu MATE has surplus funds we will make
contributions to Open Source projects, or developers working on
projects, that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

This month Ubuntu MATE has paid several Open Source developers to work
on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer of (*Fedora*) - **&euro;200** For bug fixing MATE Desktop 1.16 and working on the MATE spin of Fedora 25.
  * Developer of (*Ubuntu MATE*) **&pound;600** - For working on Ubuntu MATE Welcome and Boutique full-time for one week.  

Unfortunately one of the MATE Developers is having difficulty with
their bank and has been unable to received their July, August,
September, October or November sponsorship from Ubuntu MATE. **We have
&euro;600 set aside for when we are able to make a successful
transfer.**

Thank you to everyone who has invested in Ubuntu MATE, you are really
making a difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE
Desktop.
