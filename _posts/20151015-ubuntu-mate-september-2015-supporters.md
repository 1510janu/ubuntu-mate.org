First of all, sorry this months supporter update is late. We've been
super busy finishing off Ubuntu MATE 15.10 and something had to give.
Sorry, I hope you all understand.

Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for September 2015.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for September 2015.
  * **&pound;65** Raspberry Pi Touch Display and Stand
    * So we can make sure Ubuntu MATE supports it.

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~500 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and
another ~1100 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2.

Given that we have committed to support Ubuntu MATE 14.04 until 2019
these donations are much appreciated and help cover the bandwidth costs
and fund the development servers we need to prepare new .iso images for
Ubuntu MATE 14.04.

**Thank you!**

## Saving some funds for future projects

Although we have a surplus of funds this month we did not sponsor any
other projects. This break in tradition is for two reasons:

  * Ubuntu MATE 15.10 for the Raspberry Pi 2 will be released next week
  and we anticiapte a surge in downloads. We are putting some cash aside
  for what we expect to be an expensive bandwidth bill next month :-)
  * We are going to run some small paid projects for Ubuntu MATE during
  the 16.04 development cycle. We are saving the remainder of this months
  surplus for that initiative, the details of which will be shared here
  in due course.

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit everyone.
If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our community.
