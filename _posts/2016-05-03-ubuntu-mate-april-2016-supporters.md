**We are completely overwhelmed with the generostiy you've shown the Ubuntu
MATE project following the 16.04 LTS release. It is humbling indeed!**

Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to reward some
developers for working on Ubuntu MATE projects.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and server costs for April 2016.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for April 2016.
  * Spent **&pound;62.90** on 2x Raspberry Pi 3 Mobel B for development and testing.
  * Spent **&pound;52.00** on 20x 4GB USB 2.0 memory sticks and 10x 2GB USB 2.0 memory sticks
    * These were flashed with Ubuntu MATE 16.04 (amd64 and i386) and handed out to visitors to the 11th Egham Raspberry Jam.
  * Donated **&euro;690** (taking into account currency variations) to 4 Open Source developers working on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
  * This brings Ubuntu MATEs total donations to other Open Source projects and developers to approximately **$5310.90** (taking into account currency variations).
  * We will be reviewing how we can put the surplus of donations from April to good use and expand our contributor rewards to fund some additional development activities.

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu
family, and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the
Canonical mirror network, **we are serving ~2000 downloads per day for
Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3** and another
~170 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a
contribution to an Open Source project or developer that Ubuntu MATE
directly benefits from.

For April 2016 Ubuntu MATE have donated to several Open Source
developers who've worked on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer of (*Ubuntu MATE*) - **&pound;150** for developing Ubuntu MATE Welcome and updating the Ubuntu MATE website.
  * Developer of (*Fedora*) - **&euro;150** for porting MATE Desktop to GTK3 and preparing MATE 1.14 for release.
  * Developer of (*Linux Mint*) - **&euro;150** for porting MATE Desktop to GTK3 and preparing MATE 1.14 for release.
  * Developer of (*Debian*) **&euro;150** for packaging MATE Desktop in Debian.
  * Developer of (*Debian*) - **&euro;100** for packaging  for packaging MATE Desktop in Debian.

Thank you to everyone who has donated, you are really making a
difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE Desktop.
