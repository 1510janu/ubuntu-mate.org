Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to reward some other
projects that Ubuntu MATE benefits from.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for August 2015.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for August 2015.
  * Donated **$198** to Debian developer and package maintainer for MATE.
  * Donated **€50** to [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/).
  * Donated **$50** to [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/).
  * This months donations to other Open Source projects brings our
  running total to approximately **$1869** (taking into account currency variations)

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~500 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and
another ~1100 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2.

Given that we have committed to support Ubuntu MATE 14.04 until 2019
these donations are much appreciated and help cover the bandwidth costs
and fund the development servers we need to prepare new .iso images for
Ubuntu MATE 14.04.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source Projects

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a
contribution to an Open Source project that Ubuntu MATE directly
benefits from.

For August 2015 Ubuntu MATE have sponsored [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org)
and [VLC](http://www.videolan.org). We are therefore delighted to be
able to donate **€50** to OpenBSD and **$50** to VLC.

OpenBSD is the funding framework for a number of projects, including
[OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/). OpenSSH is an essential tool, one
that many people depend upon and is used extensively to manage the
Ubuntu MATE infrastructure.

VLC is the ubiquitous audio and video player and swiss army knife for
all manner of audio and video wrangling, not just on Linux but those
lesser known proprietary operating systems too. Switching to VLC was
overwhlemingly supported by the Ubuntu MATE community, so we know you
love it too.

### Donations to MATE Desktop

Those of you who have downloaded Ubuntu MATE from this website will have
noticed the *Download Tip* we place on the page. We've made it clear
that those tips are shared between the Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop
projects.

This month we've donated directly to one of the Debian developers.

  * **$198** to Debian developer and package maintainer for MATE.

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit everyone.
