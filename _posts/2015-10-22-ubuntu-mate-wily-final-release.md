## What works?

People tell us that Ubuntu MATE is stable. You may, or may not, agree.

## What changed since the Ubuntu MATE 15.10 Beta 2 release?

Here's what changed in Ubuntu MATE 15.10 since Beta 2.

  * Fixed `update-manager` and `do-release-upgrade` to upgrade from Ubuntu MATE 15.04 to Ubuntu MATE 15.10.
    * Although this is not supported on the Raspberry Pi 2 images.
  * Fixed the openSUSE panel layout, GNOME Main Menu no longer crashes.
  * Fixed `ubi-timezone` error in Ubiquity.
  * Fixed Caja undelete, which was causing Caja to crash or fail to undelete.
  * Updated MATE Tweak to 3.5.2a
    * Remove all deprecated GTK properties.
    * Make irrelevant UI elements insensitive rather than being hidden.
    * Fix retaining the current theme settings when switching to Metacity.
    * Fix Plank not being left running when saving a custom theme.
    * Fix leaving multiple volume applets enabled when switching panel layouts.
    * Fix CTRL+C not closing MATE Tweak.
  * Updated Ubuntu MATE Welcome to 1.0.3.5
    * Removed Simple Screen Recorder, it is not compatible with Ubuntu MATE 15.10 or any 15.10 flavour.
    * Remove Synapse, it has an intermitent issue resulting in segmentation fault on Ubuntu MATE 15.10.
  * Updated the boot screen artwork in the ISO image. Bigger, more consistent, and higher contrast for visually impaired users.
  * Updated Plank to 0.10.1.
  * Prepared Ubuntu MATE 15.10 for the Raspberry Pi 2.
