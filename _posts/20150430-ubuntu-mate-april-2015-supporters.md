Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to reward some other
projects that Ubuntu MATE benefits from.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for April 2015.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for April 2015.
  * Donated €87.50 to [MATE Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org).
  * Donated €75 to [Debian](http://www.debian.org).
  * Donated €75 to [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com).
  * We have some domain renewals coming up at the end of May so some surplus has
  been reserved to ensure we can cover those costs.

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and therefore new Ubuntu MATE releases are distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~900 downloads of Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and 14.10 per day
from our servers. Given that we have committed to support Ubuntu MATE 14.04
until 2019 these donations are much appreciated and help cover the bandwidth
costs and fund the development servers we need to prepare new .iso images for
Ubuntu MATE 14.04.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source Projects

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise that. Each
month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a contribution to an
Open Source project that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

Ubuntu MATE is built on top of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) which in turn is
derived from [Debian](http://www.debian.org). With Debian and Ubuntu both having
releases in April 2015 it is fitting that Ubuntu MATE recognise the two
distributions on which is so depends. We are therefore delighted to be able to
donate $75 to Debian and also $75 to Ubuntu. The Ubuntu donation was split
equally between *Ubuntu Desktop*, *Ubuntu for Phone* and *Community Projects*.

### Donations to MATE Desktop

Those of you who have downloaded Ubuntu MATE from this website recently will
have noticed the *Download Tip* we place on the page. We've made it clear
that those tips are shared between the Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
We have donated half the download tips from April 2015, which we are pleased
to say amounts to €87.50.

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit everyone.
If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our community.
