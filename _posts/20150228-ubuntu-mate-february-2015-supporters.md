Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to reward some other
projects that Ubuntu MATE benefits from.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for February 2015.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for February 2015.
  * Purchase Raspberry Pi 2 to help with developing Ubuntu MATE 15.10 for Raspberry Pi 2.
  * Purchase ODROID C1 to help with developing Ubuntu MATE 15.10 for ODROID C1.

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu
family, and therefore new Ubuntu MATE releases are distrubuted via the
Canonical mirror network, we are still serving ~900 downloads of Ubuntu
MATE 14.04 and 14.10 per day from our servers. Given that we have
committed to support Ubuntu MATE 14.04 until 2019 these donations are
much appreciated and help cover the bandwidth costs and fund the
development servers when we need to prepare new .iso images for Ubuntu
MATE 14.04.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source Projects

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise that.
Each month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a
contribution to an Open Source project that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits
from. This months choice was easy. We recieved an email that read as
follows:

  > THANKS a lot for including my 2 apps (Gufw & Folder Color) in Ubuntu
  MATE!! It's an honor for me :$ If you want, you have got my permission
  for removing the donate menu entry in Folder Color in Ubuntu MATE.
  >
  Why? Because I'm impressed with your professional & hard work and I
  love the MATE project.

So, we are delighted to say that Ubuntu MATE has donated $50 to the
Folder Color project and also $50 to the Gufw project.

Thank you for creating two great applications, one that improves
the security of Ubuntu MATE users and another that enhances their
productivity. Thank you for generously explaining how to disable the
donate links within the Folder Color application, I hope our donations
go some way to repaying you?

### Donations to MATE Desktop

Those of you who have downloaded Ubuntu MATE from this website recently
will have noticed the *Download Tip* we place on the page. We've made it
clear that those tips are shared between the Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop
projects. We have donated half the download tips from January 2015 and
February 2015 to MATE Desktop, which we are pleased to say amounts to â‚¬30.

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit
everyone. If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our community.
