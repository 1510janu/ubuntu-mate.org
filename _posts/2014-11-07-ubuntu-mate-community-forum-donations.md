A couple of months ago [I asked if the Ubuntu MATE community was interested in
expanding without using social networks](/blog/alternative-community-forum-poll/).
The answer was clear. Yes, you do.

The Ubuntu MATE team have decided to use [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/)
to provide a community space that is not reliant on social networks but this
will require a new, fairly beefy, virtual private server and some additional
subscription services for email notifications. We are asking the Ubuntu MATE
community members to make a small recurring contribution so that we can
provide what you've asked for.

If this funding campaign generates more monthly income than required for our
hosting alone then we will use the surplus to reward contributors, such as
digital artists/designers, provide development bounties for implementing
new features or fixing bugs and to help subsidise the travel expenses of team
members to represent [MATE Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org) and Ubuntu MATE
at FLOSS conferences. If we have sufficient extra funds we will also donate
to other Open Source projects that Ubuntu MATE depends upon and should we find
ourselves in that fortunate position we will use our new shiny Discourse
community to vote for the worthy beneficiaries.

We have set up a number of payment options that should hopefully suit everyone.
Go on, be brilliant, help grow our community.
