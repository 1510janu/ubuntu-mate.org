Ubuntu MATE forges exciting partnership with Linux hardware startup [Entroware](https://www.entroware.com).

Ubuntu MATE is a brand new official flavour of Ubuntu focussed on usability and
stability, which has gained massive traction in the Linux community over the
past few months. Inspired by the traditional GNOME 2 interface of classic Ubuntu
releases, Ubuntu MATE is the perfect distribution for easing the transition
between Microsoft Windows or Mac OS and Linux.

**With verified Linux compatible components, the Orion is designed with portability and style in mind.**

Entroware is a start up geared towards providing a complete *"out of the box"*
Linux experience, with a heavy focus on hardware compatibility. While Entroware
currently ships with Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10, as of the Ubuntu MATE 15.04 release,
Entroware will be offering the option to purchase machines with Ubuntu MATE
pre-installed along with full support.

Both Entroware and the Ubuntu MATE project are excited by this new partnership
and look forward to what their collaboration can produce over the coming months.
