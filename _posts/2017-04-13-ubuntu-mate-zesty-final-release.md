**We're totally over the bloody moon to announce Ubuntu MATE 17.04.
This is our favourite release of Ubuntu MATE so far and, we believe, a
real return to form. Ubuntu MATE 16.10 was a transitional release, in
every sense, and 17.04 concludes the upheaval of migrating to GTK3+.
This has been a release focused on refining the distro and sweating the
details. As always, we're never finished and eager to start work on
17.10 to bring you futher improvements and refinement. But for now, we
hope you enjoy Ubuntu MATE 17.04 as much as we've enjoyed making it
for you.**

# What's New in Ubuntu MATE 17.04?

We've put a great deal of effort into refining Ubuntu MATE 17.04 in the
following ways:

  * The [MATE Desktop team](https://github.com/orgs/mate-desktop/teams)
  did an amazing job releasing [MATE Desktop 1.18.0](http://mate-desktop.org/blog/2017-03-13-mate-1-18-released/)
  which completes the transition to GTK3+, fixes countless bugs and
  introduces some much needed new features and modernisations.

  * [Daniel For√©](http://danielfore.com/) from [elementary](https://elementary.io)
  contributed new icons to Ubuntu MATE which deliver style and panache.

  * [Ikey Doherty](https://plus.google.com/+IkeyDoherty) from [Solus](https://solus-project.com/)
  created [Brisk Menu](https://github.com/solus-project/brisk-menu) in
  collaboration with Ubuntu MATE. This efficient menu is integrated in
  the new Pantheon layout available via MATE Tweak.

  * Dave from [Linux & Other Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQpkMe-SLNg0HwWCP3eeTxw)
  contributed a new dark theme, called Ambiant-MATE Dark. We love it!

  * [Wolfgang Ulbrich](https://github.com/raveit65) from [MATE Desktop](https://mate-desktop.org)
  worked tirelessly on all the Ubuntu MATE themes making them all fully 
  compatible with GTK 3.22 add ensuring every pixel is placed exactly
  where it should be.

  * [Michael Tunnel](http://michaeltunnell.com/) from [TuxDigitial](http://tuxdigital.com/)
  contributed retouched art assets for the Ubuntu MATE themes including
  scaled variants for when we are ready to go HiDPI.

  * [Luke Horwell](https://ubuntu-mate.community/users/lah7) from [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org)
  updated the Bulk Queue in Ubuntu MATE Welcome and the Software Boutique
  so you can now queue up multiple application install/remove and execute
  them in one operation.

  * [Martin Wimpress](https://flexion.org) from [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org)
  did some stuff but no one remembers what.

**We extend our sincere thanks to everyone who contributed to this
Ubuntu MATE release. Thank you!**

### Ubuntu MATE issues

  * After completing an OEM install two network icons are present in the panel. (LP: [#1674796](http://pad.lv/1674796))
    * This only happens when the OEM configuration is completed. On subsequent boots only one network icon is shown.

You'll also want to check the Ubuntu MATE bug tracker to see what has
already been reported.
