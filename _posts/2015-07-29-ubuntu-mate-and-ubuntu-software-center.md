Last night I discovered that my decision to remove the Ubuntu Software Center 
from the default install on Ubuntu MATE 15.10 has caused quite a stir. I genuinely
had no idea.

This blog post tries to clarify the situation by embedding the discussion I joined
last night on [Linux Unplugged](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linuxun/). 
But before you go clicking the play button, know this:

  * My decision to remove the Ubuntu Software Center from the default install of Ubuntu 
  MATE 15.10 was not a spiteful act. Based on the feedback I've had over the last year
  it was clear that users of Ubuntu MATE want an alternative to Ubuntu Software Center.
  I am merely trying to please those users. 
  * [Ubuntu MATE Welcome](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/ubuntu-mate-welcome-screen/1616) will
  feature from Ubuntu MATE 15.10 Alpha 2 onward. In a future version it will be capable of 
  one-click installing Ubuntu Software Center and [App Grid](http://www.appgrid.org).
  Users of Ubuntu MATE can choose which "software center" they want to use on their computers.

With that said, we discussed this is more detail last night. Have a listen.

We also got stuck into it some more in the post show.

[Jupiter Broadcasting](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/) produce a number
of weekly videocasts and podcasts mostly oriented around Linux, Open Source
and Technology. Take a look, you'll probably find something of interest.
