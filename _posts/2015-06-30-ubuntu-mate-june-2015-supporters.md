Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this month. You
have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet all the costs
associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the community site. In fact,
this month we are able to reward some other projects that Ubuntu MATE benefits
from.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for June 2015.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for June 2015.
  * &pound;91.02 to register new ubuntu-mate domains, one is now in use as the [Ubuntu MATE Boutique](https://ubuntu-mate.boutique)
  * Donated **€50** to [Geany](http://www.geany.org/).
  * Donated **€50** to [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/).
  * Donated **$264** to MATE Desktop developers.
    * **$132** to MATE developer and MATE package maintainer for [Fedora](http://getfedora.org).
    * **$132** to MATE developer and MATE package maintainer for [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com).
  * This months donations to other Open Source projects brings our running total to approximately **$1224** (taking into account currency variations)

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~500 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and
another ~1000 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2. 

Given that we have committed to support Ubuntu MATE 14.04 until 2019
these donations are much appreciated and help cover the bandwidth costs
and fund the development servers we need to prepare new .iso images for
Ubuntu MATE 14.04. We are currently hosting the Ubuntu MATE for Raspberry
Pi 2 images on Sourceforge, but plan to migrate to our own download
servers in July.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source Projects

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise that. Each
month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a contribution to an
Open Source project that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from. 

For June 2015 Ubuntu MATE have sponsored [Geany](http://www.geany.org/)
and [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/). We also approached
[guvcview](http://guvcview.sourceforge.net/), but they politely declined our
donation, simply explaining that they make guvcview for the love of it `:-)`

I (Martin Wimpress) use Geany as my main IDE for all development work I
do on Ubuntu MATE, [Debian](http://debian.org), [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org)
and the [MATE Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org). It is an indespensible
tool that optimises my work flow so I can make my limited development
time as productive as possible. Ubuntu MATE 15.10 will feature a new
Welcome screen and included in the Welcome screen is a one-click
installer for *"best of breed"* applications that integrate well with
Ubuntu MATE. Geany was one of the first applications to be added `:-)`

Transmission has always been shipped by default with Ubuntu MATE and has
been extremely useful for grabbing new distros to experiment with and get
inspiration from and also seeding Ubuntu MATE torrents. In the early days
of Ubunut MATE 14.10, Transmission was an essential tool for getting the
new images off the build servers and onto test servers.

We are therefore delighted to be able to donate **$50** to Geany and also
**$50** to Transmission.

### Donations to MATE Desktop

Those of you who have downloaded Ubuntu MATE from this website will have
noticed the *Download Tip* we place on the page. We've made it clear
that those tips are shared between the Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop
projects. We have donated half the download tips from June 2015, which
we are pleased to say amounts to **$264**, to MATE Desktop.

This month we've done something a little different and donated directly
to some of the upstream MATE developers.

  * **$132** to MATE developer and MATE package maintainer for [Fedora](http://getfedora.org).
  * **$132** to MATE developer and MATE package maintainer for [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com).
  
The [upstream MATE Desktop team](http://mate-desktop.org/team/) is comprised
of maintainers and contributors to many different distributions. We 
all work together to improve MATE for any Linux and BSD user.
