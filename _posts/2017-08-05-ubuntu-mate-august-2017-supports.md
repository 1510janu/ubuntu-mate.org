Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project. **As
usual we've been able to fund some developers to work on Ubuntu MATE
and MATE Desktop projects.**

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month Ubuntu MATE has surplus funds we will make
contributions to Open Source projects, or developers working on
projects, that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Debian Developer - **&euro;250** - For packaging Caja Rename for Debian and Ubuntu.
  * MATE Developer - **&euro;200** - For developing and bug fixing MATE Desktop.
  * MATE Developer - **&euro;200** - For developing and bug fixing MATE Desktop.
