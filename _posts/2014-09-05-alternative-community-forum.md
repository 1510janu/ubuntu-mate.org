I have noticed that a few members of the Ubuntu MATE community have
expressed an interest in a forum that is not powered by a social network.
We've conducted all previous polls via the
[Ubuntu MATE Google+ community](/communtiy/), but holding such a vote on
G+ may skew the results. So please cast your vote below and if there is
enough interest we can explore the options.
