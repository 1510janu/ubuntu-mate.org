Some good news for Ubuntu MATE users in Germany.

I spent last weekend at the [X2Go](http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php) *"gathering"*
in Essen, Germany. While there I got confirmation that
[Linux Welt](http://www.idg.com/www/IDGProducts.nsf/ByKey/Germany_Publication_Linux-Welt)
magazine will feature Ubuntu MATE in their 2015-01 edition. LinuxWelt is
Germany's best selling bi-monthly Linux and Open-Source magazine and is
available in book stores all over Germany and via
[IDG's online shop](http://www.idgshop.de/linuxwelt-magazin-abo-shop.htm?websale8=idg&ci=linuxwelt).

[David Wolski](https://plus.google.com/110617257769010375872) sent me a
draft PDF of the Ubuntu MATE feature which one of the X2Go developers
kindly translated for me at the weekend.

Ubuntu MATE 14.10 will also be the cover DVD feature and LinuxWelt have
commissioned approximately 50,000 DVDs that will include the 32 bit
version of Ubuntu MATE 14.10.

I encourage our German members to buy the LinuxWelt 2015-01 edition and
for the rest of you re-share this blog post to help repay the support
LinuxWelt have shown the Ubuntu MATE project. That said, earlier this
evening I got another email from David Wolski with more good news. David
has negotiated with [IDG](http://www.idg.com/) (his publisher) to
release the Ubuntu MATE feature article as a free download. And here it
is.

{% include blog/jumbotron.html
    title = "LinuxWelt coverage of Ubuntu MATE 14.10"
    text = "Two page feature article about Ubuntu MATE 14.10 from LinuxWelt magazine."
    button_text = "Download PDF"
    button_url = "/assets/pdf/LW_01_2015_Ubuntu_MATE_14.10.pdf"
%}

You can also check out the link below for the online PC Welt summary of
Ubuntu MATE and access the direct downloads of the Ubuntu MATE 14.10 .iso
images they are hosting for us and the PDF of the article. What
brilliant people!
