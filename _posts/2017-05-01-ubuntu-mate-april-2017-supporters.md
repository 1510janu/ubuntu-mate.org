Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project. **As
usual we've been able to fund some developers to work on Ubuntu MATE
and MATE Desktop projects.**

A huge thank you to everyone at

sponsoring Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop**. Bytemark are providing hosting
and covering all server/bandwidth costs for both projects. This

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month Ubuntu MATE has surplus funds we will make
contributions to Open Source projects, or developers working on
projects, that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

This month Ubuntu MATE has paid several Open Source developers to work
on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer from *[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)* - **&euro;100.00** - For maintaining/fixing Engrampa and working on MATE Themes.
  * Developer from *[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)* - **&euro;350** - For improving the Ubuntu MATE themes.
  * Developer from *[Vala Panel AppMenu](https://github.com/rilian-la-te/vala-panel-appmenu)* - **&pound;120** - For refining and fixing Vala Panel AppMenu.

Thank you to everyone who has invested in Ubuntu MATE, you are really
making a difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE
Desktop.
