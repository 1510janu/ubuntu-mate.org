Ubuntu MATE is an official flavour of Ubuntu focussed on usability and
stability, which has gained massive traction in the Linux community
over recent months. Inspired by the traditional GNOME 2 interface of
classic Ubuntu releases, Ubuntu MATE is the perfect distribution for
easing the transition between Microsoft Windows or Mac OS and Linux.

experience, with a heavy focus on hardware compatibility. All the hardware in
