Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been most generous and ensured that we can fund a new
Ubuntu MATE community site. 

## How will these donations be spent?

These initial donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and build server costs to date!
  * The one time setup costs for the new server to host the new community site.
  * The first month of hosting the new community site.
  * The production of an Ubuntu MATE T-shirt and international shipping charges for the core contributors to Ubuntu MATE 14.10.

Thank you!

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit
everyone. If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our community.
