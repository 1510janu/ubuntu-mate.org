Please join me in welcoming [Goce Mitevski](http://nicer2.com/),
[Ivan PejiÄ‡](https://plus.google.com/113587242852192152625/)
and [Jack Mohegan](https://plus.google.com/101312215214323407176/)
to the Ubuntu MATE team! They have all graciously accepted positions
on the [Ubuntu MATE Artwork and Design team](/team/).

Goce, Ivan and Jack have been hard at work creating themes and artwork
for Ubuntu MATE Beta1. Between them they have created a great selection
of Ubuntu MATE wallpapers (both for desktop and LightDM), SYSLINUX theme,
Plymouth themes and Ubiquity slides are currently in the final stages of
preparation.

We've added a [screen shot slideshow to the home page](/) so you
can see how Ubuntu MATE Beta1 is shaping up.

Thanks for your hard work and commitment guys, Ubuntu MATE Beta1 is
looking really great for it's August 28th release.
