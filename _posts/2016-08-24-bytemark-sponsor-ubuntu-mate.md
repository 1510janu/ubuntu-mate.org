A couple of weeks ago the [Bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/r/ubuntu-mate/) Managing Director,
[Matthew Bloch](https://twitter.com/matthewbloch), contacted the Ubuntu
MATE team to offer free hosting for the project. As of August 18th 2016
all the Ubuntu MATE infrastucture is hosted on [Bytemark Cloud Servers](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/cloud/).

**[Bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/r/ubuntu-mate/) are generously sponsoring Ubuntu MATE**


## Why did Bytemark make such a generous offer?

Well, it turns out they're a bunch of [good eggs](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/good%20egg)
who've been sponsoring free software projects and free culture podcasts
since Bytemark was formed. Other projects currently being suported by
Bytemark include [Debian](https://www.debian.org/),
[LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/),
[Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), [My
Society](https://www.mysociety.org/) and [Code
Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/).

### [Matthew Bloch](https://twitter.com/matthewbloch) had this to say:

> I'm happy to announce that Bytemark is supporting the [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/what-is-ubuntu-mate/) operating system
> project, which is based on a traditional computer desktop. We're
> providing hosting for its community forums & wiki and bandwidth for its
> very popular Raspberry Pi distribution.
>
> The MATE project's admirable goal is "to add support for new
> technologies while preserving a classic desktop experience". Ubuntu
> MATE combines this desktop with the well-tested OS base of
> [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) (which itself builds on our first love
> [Debian](https://www.debian.org). All of that ensures that anyone who
> wants a simple computer desktop can get one, on any computer, free of
> charge.
>
> Personally speaking, Ubuntu MATE feels like a great model for a free
> software community. They run a crowd-funding campaign and write a
> [monthly report](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-july-2016-supporters/)
> on exactly how those funds are spent. After paying direct costs, they
> pay contributors to work on much-needed features, and also to
> developers of other projects that they depend on. While the amounts
> might be small, this is uncommon ambition, and a sign of a well-managed
> and motivated community.
>

### And [Martin Wimpress](https://twitter.com/m_wimpress) had this to say:

> I am absolutely delighted that Bytemark reached out to Ubuntu MATE and
> generously offered to cover all our hosting and bandwidth requirements.
> We now have a resilient pair of geographically separated [Cloud Servers](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/cloud/)
> powering the Ubuntu MATE websites, [community forums](https://ubuntu-mate.community) and Raspberry Pi
> image downloads. This will enable Ubuntu MATE to channel far more of
> the money raised via our crowd-funding into sponsored development of
> Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop related projects. In Bytemark we have
> found a company whose commitment and beliefs towards free software are
> aligned with our own. On behalf of the Ubuntu MATE community I extend
> my sincere thanks to everyone at Bytemark for their support.
