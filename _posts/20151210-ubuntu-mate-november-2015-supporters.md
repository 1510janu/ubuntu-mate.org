Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for November 2015.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for November 2015.
  * **&pound;48.76** for mate-desktop.org (and .net, .com, .info) domain renewals.
  * **$20 per month** for mate-desktop.org to be added to CloudFlare.
  * **&pound;94.98** for a Raspberry Pi 2 with 1TB hard drive to do nightly backups of mate-desktop.org.

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~500 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and
another ~1200 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2.

**Thank you!**

## Saving some funds for future projects

We did have a surplus of funds this month but we did not sponsor any other
projects. This break in tradition is for two reasons:

  * We have some upcoming infrastructure upgrade costs we need to plan for.
  * Ubuntu MATE 15.10 for the Raspberry Pi 2 is very popular and we have
  a significant upturn in bandwidth usage as a result.
  * We are going to run some small paid projects for Ubuntu MATE during
  the 16.04 development cycle. We are saving the remainder of this months
  surplus for that initiative, the details of which will be shared here
  in due course.

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit everyone.
If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our community.
