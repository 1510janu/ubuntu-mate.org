Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to reward some other
projects that Ubuntu MATE benefits from.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for December 2015.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for December 2015.
  * **&pound;120.30** for Ubuntu Pi Flavour Maker domain registrations.
  * **$18.78** to renew SSL/TLS certificates for Ubuntu MATE Community site.
  * **$234.78** to upgraded server infrastructure (5 nodes) to support Raspberry Pi 2 image downloads.
  * **&pound;100** donated to, Ubuntu MATE developer.

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~500 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and
another ~1200 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source Projects

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a
contribution to an Open Source project or developer that Ubuntu MATE
directly benefits from.

For December 2015 Ubuntu MATE have donated **Â£100** a developer contributing
to Ubuntu MATE for some time now and is co-developer of Ubuntu MATE Welcome.
Luke is taking on the lead developer role for an as yet unannounced project,
has recently become an Administrator for the Ubuntu MATE Community and is
also working on various artwork improvements. Some of the money donated will
go towards a [Raspberry Pi 2](/raspberry-pi/) development machine so Luke can
help ensure Ubuntu MATE Welcome is well supported on the Pi 2.

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit everyone.
If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our community.
