Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to fund some developers
to work on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.

## How will this months crowd funding be spent?

This months crowd funding will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE CDN, WAF and email charges for August 2016.
  * Paid **&euro;739** (taking into account currency variations) to 4 Open Source developers for working on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
  * This brings Ubuntu MATEs total funding to other Open Source projects and developers to approximately **$9569.14** (taking into account currency variations).

**Thank you!**

## Project Sponsorship

A huge thank you to everyone at **[Bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/r/ubuntu-mate/)**
for sponsoring Ubuntu MATE and covering all our hosting and server costs
for August 2016. This [sponsorship means most of the Ubuntu MATE crowd
funding can be directed towards funding development projects](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/bytemark-sponsor-ubuntu-mate/). `:-D`

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a
contribution to an Open Source project or developer that Ubuntu MATE
directly benefits from.

For August 2016 Ubuntu MATE have paid several Open Source developers
to work on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer of (*Fedora*) - **&euro;350** For migrating Ubuntu MATE themes to GTK 3.20
  * Developer of (*Ubuntu MATE*) **&pound;100** - For developing Ubuntu MATE Welcome.
  * Developer of (*Debian*) - **&euro;150** For reviewing and sponsoring uploads of MATE 1.14 to Debian.
  * Developer of (*Ubuntu MATE*) **&pound;100** - For developing MATE Dock Applet.

Unfortunately one of the MATE Developer is having difficulty with their
bank and has been unable to received their July or August sponsorship
from Ubuntu MATE. We have â‚¬200 set aside for when we are able to make a
successful transfer.

Thank you to everyone who has invested in Ubuntu MATE, you are really
making a difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE
Desktop.
