## Thank You!

Thanks to everyone who contributed to Ubuntu MATE 16.04. 
There are quite a few people who deserve a public *"Thank you!"*.

### Community

A very special *Thank you* to **[Luke 
Horwell](https://ubuntu-mate.community/users/lah7/)** for taking Ubuntu MATE 
Welcome to the next level. Ubuntu MATE Welcome and the Software Boutique have 
become a central part of the Ubuntu MATE experience and it is Luke we need to 
thank for really making them standout features. Also thanks to **[Robin 
Thompson](https://github.com/robint99)**, author of MATE Dock Applet, who did 
the lions share of adding a translation framework to Ubuntu MATE Welcome which 
is now available in 20 languages.

Thanks to **[Mike Gabriel](https://sunweavers.net/blog/)** the Debian 
Developer heading up the Debian MATE Packaging team. The vast majority of 
Ubuntu MATE development actually happens in Debian and we owe a huge debt of 
gratitude to Mike for his tireless efforts, mentoring and guidance.

Thanks to **[Joe Ressington](http://joeress.com/about)**, **[Isaac 
Carter](http://twitter.com/stupidcoder)** and **[Albert 
Hickey](http://plus.google.com/+Winkleink)**, from [The Pi 
Podcast](http://thepipodcast.com/), for testing Ubuntu MATE 16.04 for the 
Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3. You really helped ironout some kinks and 
improved the release quality for everyone.

Thank you to **[Alexei 
Sorokin](https://build.opensuse.org/user/show/XRevan86)** and **[Alberts 
Muktupāvels](https://launchpad.net/~albertsmuktupavels)** for their help 
improving MATE integration in Compiz.

**[Gunnar Hjalmarsson](https://launchpad.net/~gunnarhj)** for his help making 
`im-config` and `gnome-language-selector` compatible with Ubuntu MATE and 
**[Rico Tzschichholz](https://launchpad.net/~ricotz)** for his help completing 
MATE integration for Synapse and the new version of Plank.

Thanks you to the follow people for creating the new wallpaper backgrounds for 
Ubuntu MATE 16.04,
