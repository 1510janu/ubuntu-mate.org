For my friends at [#systemau](https://systemau.net.au/) who lament the often 
predictable wording of Linux distro release announcements, we'd just like to 
say; **Beaut, beauty! We're stoked to announced Ubuntu MATE 16.10 Alpha 1, the 
first distro to ship a full MATE Desktop implementation built against GTK3+. 
Some thought we'd let the kangaroos loose in the top paddock by being the 
first distro to switch to GTK3+ and it would all come a gutser. But we put in 
heaps of effort to ensure it's not complete ball dust. Bonzer! Give it a 
burl.**

We are preparing Ubuntu MATE 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) for distribution on
[October 13th, 2016](https://wiki.ubuntu.org/YakketyYak/ReleaseSchedule)
With this *Alpha* pre-release, you can see what we are trying out in
preparation for our next (stable) version.

## What works?

People tell us that Ubuntu MATE is stable. You may, or may not, agree.

Ubuntu MATE *Alpha Releases* are *NOT* recommended for:

  * Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues
  * Anyone who needs a stable system
  * Anyone uncomfortable running a possibly frequently broken system
