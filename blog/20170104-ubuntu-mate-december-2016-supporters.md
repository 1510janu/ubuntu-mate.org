Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project. **As
usual we've been able to fund some developers to work on Ubuntu MATE
and MATE Desktop projects.**

## How will this months crowd funding be spent?

This months crowd funding will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE Content Delivery Network, Web Application Firewall and email charges for December 2016.
  * Paid **&euro;1455** (taking into account currency variations) to Open Source developers for working on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
  * This brings Ubuntu MATEs total funding of Open Source projects and developers to approximately **$13773.23** (taking into account currency variations).

**Thank you!**

## Project Sponsorship

A huge thank you to everyone at
**[Bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/r/ubuntu-mate/) for
sponsoring Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop**. Bytemark are providing hosting
and covering all server/bandwidth costs for both projects. This
[sponsorship means nearly all of the Ubuntu MATE crowd
funding can be directed towards funding development
projects](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/bytemark-sponsor-ubuntu-mate/).

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month Ubuntu MATE has surplus funds we will make
contributions to Open Source projects, or developers working on
projects, that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

This month Ubuntu MATE has paid several Open Source developers to work
on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer of (*Fedora*) - **&euro;100** For developing/testing MATE Desktop 1.17, the current in development snapshot.
  * Developer of (*Debian*) - **&euro;100** For updating and uploading of MATE Desktop 1.16 fixes to Debian.
  * Developer of (*Solus*) - **&pound;500** For working on [Brisk Menu](https://github.com/solus-project/brisk-menu), a efficient menu for the MATE Desktop.
  * Developer of (*elementary*) - **$700** For [updating the folder icons used in Ambiant-MATE and Radiant-MATE](https://github.com/flexiondotorg/ubuntu-mate-themes/pull/45).

Unfortunately one of the MATE Developers is having difficulty with
their bank and has been unable to receive sponsorship payments since
July 2016 and they have also completed a MATE Desktop development
project that has a $1000 bounty. **We have
&euro;1600 set aside for when we are able to make a successful
transfer.**

Thank you to everyone who has invested in Ubuntu MATE, you are really
making a difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE
Desktop.
