Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this month. You
have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet all the costs
associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the community site. In fact,
this month we are able to reward some other projects that Ubuntu MATE benefits
from.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for March 2015.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for March 2015.
  * Donated €70 to [MATE Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org).
  * Donated €50 to [Tilda](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda).
  * Donated €50 to [Plank](https://launchpad.net/plank).
  * Purchase microSD cards to give away, with Ubuntu MATE installed, at a Raspberry Pi Jam.

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and therefore new Ubuntu MATE releases are distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~900 downloads of Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and 14.10 per day
from our servers. Given that we have committed to support Ubuntu MATE 14.04
until 2019 these donations are much appreciated and help cover the bandwidth
costs and fund the development servers we need to prepare new .iso images for
Ubuntu MATE 14.04.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source Projects

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise that. Each
month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a contribution to an
Open Source project that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from. 

We are delighted to announce that Ubuntu MATE has donated €50 to
the [Tilda](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda) project and also €50 to the
[Plank](https://launchpad.net/plank) project.

These are two great applications, both improve the user experience of Ubuntu
MATE 15.04. The addition of Tilda generated an awful lot of attention for Ubuntu
MATE and has proven an extremely useful development tool. Plank is well known,
and loved, by many Linux users. Plank (and Docky before it) have been an
essential part of my desktop set-up for years.

### Donations to MATE Desktop

Those of you who have downloaded Ubuntu MATE from this website recently will
have noticed the *Download Tip* we place on the page. We've made it clear
that those tips are shared between the Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
We have donated half the download tips from March 2015, which we are pleased
to say amounts to €70.

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit everyone.
If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our community.
