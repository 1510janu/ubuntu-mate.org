Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to reward some
developers for working on Ubuntu MATE projects.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and server costs for March 2016.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for March 2016.
  * Spent **&pound;246.85** on domain renewals.
  * Donated **&euro;450** (taking into account currency variations) to 4 Open Source developers working on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
  * This brings Ubuntu MATEs total donations to other Open Source projects and developers to approximately **$4513.87** (taking into account currency variations).
  * We're keeping some funds in reserve because Ubuntu MATE 16.04 for the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 will be released soon and we anticipate a spike in bandwidth costs.

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu
family, and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the
Canonical mirror network, **we are serving ~2000 downloads per day for
Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3** and another
~170 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a
contribution to an Open Source project or developer that Ubuntu MATE
directly benefits from.

For March 2016 Ubuntu MATE have donated to several Open Source
developers who've worked on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer for (*Ubuntu MATE*) - **&pound;100** for working on Ubuntu MATE Welcome.
  * Developer for (*Fedora*) - **&euro;100** for porting MATE Desktop to GTK3 and preparing MATE 1.14 for release.
  * Developer for (*Linux Mint*) - **&euro;100** for porting MATE Desktop to GTK3 and preparing MATE 1.14 for release.
  * Developer for (*Ubuntu MATE*) - **&pound;100** for adding a translation framework to Ubuntu MATE Welcome and working on MATE Dock applet.

Thank you to everyone who has donated, you are really making a
difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE Desktop.
