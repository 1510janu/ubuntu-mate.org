## What works?

People tell us that Ubuntu MATE is stable. You may, or may not, agree.

## What changed since the release candidate?

This release has fixed a few minor issues and tweaked a couple
things.

  * Full disk encryption, or rather entering your pass phrase into Plymouth,
  was properly fixed by the Ubuntu team. 
  * Fixed missing configuration options in the workspace switcher applet [LP #1382682](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mate/+bug/1382682)
  * Fixed the live session not auto logging into the MATE desktop.
  * Added a background wall paper to Ubiquity.
