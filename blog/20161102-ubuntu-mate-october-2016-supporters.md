Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project. **As usual
we've be able to fund some developers to work on Ubuntu MATE and MATE
Desktop projects.**

## How will this months crowd funding be spent?

This months crowd funding will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE CDN, WAF and email charges for October 2016.
  * Paid **&euro;659.25** (taking into account currency variations) to Open Source developers for working on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
  * This brings Ubuntu MATEs total funding to Open Source projects and developers to approximately **$11286.87** (taking into account currency variations).
  * We're also going to experiment with [Bounty Source](https://www.bountysource.com/) for [MATE Desktop](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/mate) and [Ubuntu MATE](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/ubuntu-mate) to see if this is a suitable platform for rewarding contributors.
    * Some funds have been allocated to support this initiative.

**Thank you!**

## Project Sponsorship

A huge thank you to everyone at
**[Bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/r/ubuntu-mate/)** for
sponsoring Ubuntu MATE and covering all our hosting and server costs
yet again! This [sponsorship means most of the Ubuntu MATE crowd
funding can be directed towards funding development
projects](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/bytemark-sponsor-ubuntu-mate/).

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month Ubuntu MATE has surplus funds we will make
contributions to Open Source projects, or developers working on
projects, that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

This month Ubuntu MATE has paid several Open Source developers to work
on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer of (*Fedora*) - **&euro;350** For migrating Ubuntu MATE themes to GTK 3.20
  * Developer of (*Debian*) - **&euro;100** - For improving MATE 1.16 packaging in Debian.
  * Graphics artist - **$210** For updating the Ubuntu MATE themes image assets, including HiDPI variants.
  * Developer of (*Fedora*) - **&euro;20** For a 5 button mouse so we can test a [pull request #605 for Caja](https://github.com/mate-desktop/caja/pull/605).

Unfortunately one of the MATE Developers is having difficulty with
their bank and has been unable to received their July, August,
September or October sponsorship from Ubuntu MATE. **We have â‚¬500 set
aside for when we are able to make a successful transfer.**

Thank you to everyone who has invested in Ubuntu MATE, you are really
making a difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE
Desktop.
