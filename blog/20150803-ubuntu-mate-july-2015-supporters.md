Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to reward some other
projects that Ubuntu MATE benefits from.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for July 2015.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for July 2015.
  * &pound;147.33 to setup the [new globally distributed servers](/blog/ubuntu-mate-server-upgrades/).
  * Donated **$291** to Debian developers and maintainers.
    * **$145.50** to Debian developer and package maintainer for MATE.
    * **$145.50** to Debian maintainer and package maintainer for MATE.
  * Donated **$50** to [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).
  * This months donations to other Open Source projects brings our
  running total to approximately **$1565** (taking into account currency variations)

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~500 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and
another ~1000 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2.

Given that we have committed to support Ubuntu MATE 14.04 until 2019
these donations are much appreciated and help cover the bandwidth costs
and fund the development servers we need to prepare new .iso images for
Ubuntu MATE 14.04.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source Projects

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise that. Each
month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a contribution to an
Open Source project that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

For July 2015 Ubuntu MATE have sponsored [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).
We are therefore delighted to be able to donate **$50** to Syncthing.

Syncthing is an Open Source alternative to BitTorrent Sync.
Earlier in July 2015 [the Ubuntu MATE server infrastructure was expanded](/blog/ubuntu-mate-server-upgrades/)
to multiple servers in different geographies. A solution for syncing the
Ubuntu MATE images between those sites was required and we've used Syncthing
to do it and it has been brilliant to work with. Syncthing is now listed
in the new [Ubuntu MATE Welcome](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/ubuntu-mate-welcome-screen/1616) that featured for the first time in
[Ubuntu MATE 15.10 Alpha 2](/blog/ubuntu-mate-wily-alpha2/).

### Donations to MATE Desktop

Those of you who have downloaded Ubuntu MATE from this website will have
noticed the *Download Tip* we place on the page. We've made it clear
that those tips are shared between the Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop
projects. We have donated half the download tips from July 2015, which
we are pleased to say amounts to **$291**, to MATE Desktop.

This month we've done something a little different and donated directly
to some of the upstream MATE developers.

  * **$145.50** to Debian developer and package maintainer for MATE.
  * **$145.50** to Debian maintainer and package maintainer for MATE.

The Debian developers and maintainers have been hugely supportive of Ubuntu MATE and put significant effort into ensuring
packaging for Ubuntu MATE is completed and well supported. This has included
accepting other projects into the Debian MATE packaging team that Ubuntu MATE
relies on, such as MATE Tweak, MATE Menu, MATE Optimus, Plank and several
others.

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit everyone.
If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our community.
