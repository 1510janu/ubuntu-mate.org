Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to reward some other
projects that Ubuntu MATE benefits from.

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for January 2016.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for January 2016.
  * **&pound;79.99** for Pioneer BDR-XD05TS 6x USB3.0 External Slim Portable Blu-ray Burner.
    * This was purchased because the burner in my old desktop workstation died.
    * I needed something to burn DVDs to test the PowerPC port of Ubuntu MATE.
    * I wanted to get [Blu-ray playback working in Ubuntu MATE](https://plus.google.com/+MartinWimpress/posts/SaYoWBGeGy4), which is now done.
  * **&pound;158.40** to setup and provision two new dedicated servers.
  * **&pound;100** donated to [MATE Dock Applet](https://github.com/robint99/dock-applet).

Although Ubuntu MATE 15.04 onward is an official member of the Ubuntu family,
and new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, we are serving ~500 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04 and
another ~1200 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source Projects

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a
contribution to an Open Source project or developer that Ubuntu MATE
directly benefits from.

For January 2016 Ubuntu MATE have donated **&pound;100** to MATE Dock Applet as
it is really gaining popularity within the Ubuntu MATE community. We are
activaly working towards adding MATE Dock Applet to the Debian and
Ubuntu archives and hope to include it in Ubuntu MATE 16.04 with
a special panel layout to show off its full potential.

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit everyone.
