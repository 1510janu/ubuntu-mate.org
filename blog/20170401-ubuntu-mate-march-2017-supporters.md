Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project. **As
usual we've been able to fund some developers to work on Ubuntu MATE
and MATE Desktop projects.**
