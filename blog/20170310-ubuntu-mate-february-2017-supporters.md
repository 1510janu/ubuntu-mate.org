Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project. **As
usual we've been able to fund some developers to work on Ubuntu MATE
and MATE Desktop projects.**

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month Ubuntu MATE has surplus funds we will make
contributions to Open Source projects, or developers working on
projects, that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

This month Ubuntu MATE has paid several Open Source developers to work
on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer from *[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)* - **&euro;100** - For packaging Brisk Menu and sponsoring the upload to Debian.
  * Developer from *[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)* - **&euro;100.00** - For maintaining/fixing Engrampa from July 2016 to Januray 2017.
  * Developer from *[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)* - **&euro;150** - For working on MATE Desktop 1.17 and providing theme fixes for Ubuntu MATE.
  * Developer from *[Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)* - **&euro;500** - For refining, fixing and maintaining MATE Desktop from July 2016 to January 2017.

Thank you to everyone who has invested in Ubuntu MATE, you are really
making a difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE
Desktop.
