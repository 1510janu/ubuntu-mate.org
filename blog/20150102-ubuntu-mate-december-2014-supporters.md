Many thanks to everyone who donated to the Ubuntu MATE community this
month. You have been most generous and ensured that we can fund a new
Ubuntu MATE community site. 

## How will these donations be spent?

These donations will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and development server costs for December 2014.
  * Creation and hosting of the new community site for January 2015.
  * Funding prizes for upcoming community competitions.
  * Paid for a 2nd hand iBook G4 for developing the PowerPC edition of Ubuntu MATE.

Thank you!

## Please Donate

We have setup a number of payment options that should hopefully suit
everyone. If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our community.
