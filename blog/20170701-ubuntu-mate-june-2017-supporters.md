Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project. **As
usual we've been able to fund some developers to work on Ubuntu MATE
and MATE Desktop projects.**

## How will this months crowd funding be spent?

This months crowd funding will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE Content Delivery Network, Web Application Firewall and email charges.
  * Paid **&pound;91.95** for domain name renewals.
  * This brings Ubuntu MATEs total funding to Open Source projects and developers to approximately **$22402.35** (taking into account currency variations).

**Thank you!**

## Project Sponsorship

A huge thank you to everyone at
**[Bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/r/ubuntu-mate/) for
sponsoring Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop**. Bytemark are providing hosting
and covering all server/bandwidth costs for both projects. This
[sponsorship means nearly all of the Ubuntu MATE crowd
funding can be directed towards funding development
projects](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/bytemark-sponsor-ubuntu-mate/).

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month Ubuntu MATE has surplus funds we will make
contributions to Open Source projects, or developers working on
projects, that Ubuntu MATE directly benefits from.

This month Ubuntu MATE decide to save all the crowd funding 
contributed this month because the summer holidays are coming
soon and we have some large projects we'd like to fund and 
need to build a little surplus ahead of time.

Thank you to everyone who has invested in Ubuntu MATE, you are really
making a difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE
Desktop.

## Please Invest

everyone. If you haven't already, be brilliant, help grow our
