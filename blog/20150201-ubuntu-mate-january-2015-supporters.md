## Outgoings

In January 2015 the total outgoings for the Ubuntu MATE community was €187.87.
This is much higher than our typical projected monthly costs because it covered
the domain registration and SSL/TLS certificate for
[ubuntu-mate.community](https://ubuntu-mate.community), setup fees for the new
community server, a 2nd hand iBook G4 for developing and testing the PowerPC
edition of Ubuntu MATE in addition to the ususal server hosting for the
community sites and development servers.
