Last week I joined Rob, Scott and Joe on [mintCast](http://www.mintcast.org/)
episode 220. I had a great time and was invitied to participate as a guest 
throughout the whole show. The main feature was Ubuntu MATE where I talked
about how the project got started, how official Ubuntu status affects the
project and how the Ubuntu MATE and Linux Mint teams are collaborating.

[mintCast](http://www.mintcast.org/) put out a podcast every two weeks
and although Linux Mint features most episodes it is also a great
podcast for catching up on news in the Open Source community and the 
mintCast Team often review other interesting Open Source and Linux
projects. Add it to your pod catcher!
