Many thanks to everyone who invested in the Ubuntu MATE project this
month. You have been generous as always and ensured that we can meet
all the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE project and the
community site. In fact, this month we are able to fund some developers
to work on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.

## How will this months crowd funding be spent?

This months crowd funding will be used to pay for:

  * All Ubuntu MATE hosting and server costs for June 2016.
  * All the Ubuntu MATE CDN, bandwidth and email charges for June 2016.
  * Paid **&euro;781** (taking into account currency variations) to 5 Open Source developers for working on Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
  * This brings Ubuntu MATEs total funding to other Open Source projects and developers to approximately **$8158.09** (taking into account currency variations).
  * We will be reviewing how we can put the surplus funds from previous months to good use and expand our contributor rewards to finance some additional development activities.

Although Ubuntu MATE is an official member of the Ubuntu family, and
new Ubuntu MATE releases are now distributed via the Canonical mirror
network, **we are serving ~2000 downloads per day for Ubuntu MATE for
the Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3** and another ~95 downloads per
day for Ubuntu MATE 14.04.

**Thank you!**

## Supporting Open Source

Ubuntu MATE is comprised of many Open Source projects, we recognise
that. Each month that Ubuntu MATE has a surplus of funds we will make a
contribution to an Open Source project or developer that Ubuntu MATE
directly benefits from.

For June 2016 Ubuntu MATE have paid several Open Source developers
to work on Ubuntu MATE or MATE Desktop projects.

  * Developer of (*Ubuntu MATE*) **&pound;150** - For development of Ubuntu MATE Welcome and Software Boutique.
  * Developer of (*Fedora*) **&euro;350** - For migrating Ubuntu MATE themes to MATE 1.14 built against GTK 3.18
  * Developer of (*Debian*) **&euro;50** - For fixing and maintaining Engrampa, the MATE archive manager.
  * Developer of (*Debian*) **&euro;50** - For packaging MATE in Debian.
  * Developer of (*Linux Mint*) - **&euro;150** - For migrating MATE components to GTK3 and fixing Indicator support in MATE 1.14.

Thank you to everyone who has invested in Ubuntu MATE, you are really
making a difference to the development of Ubuntu MATE and the MATE
Desktop.
